Version Control System (VCS): A system that records/saves the changes made to a file or a group of files over a certain period of time so that we can recall a particular version later.

- It manages the changes
- keeps track of each and every change that is done to a project
- if any mistake is done, the user can compare the previous version(s) of the code and can revert to fix the problem.
- keeps the full history of the changes done - when was the change done, who made the changes, what lines were changed.
- also helps us to collborate with other team members.

GIT - is DVCS

DVCS - Distributed version control system

Few important terms:
- Repository (repo): A place where the project and its history is stored.
- Clone: Creating a repo from another repo / Copying a repo
- Initialize: Creating a new/empty repo
- Merge: Integrating the changes together
- Conflict: When different users make changes to the same file, the version control system is unable to merge/resolve it. This situation is called conflict.

3 stages of GIT:
1. Modified: means that the file is changed, but the version is not created
2. Committed: the changes that we made is safely and successfully saved/stored in the repo as a version
3. Staged: means that we have marked the changed files to create the version    
    
Basic GIT workflow:
- Modify the files in the working tree/dir
- Select the files to stage which are needed to be part of the next commit. Add only those changes to the staging area.
- Perform commit - This takes the files from the staging area and stores that snapshop permanently to the local GIT repo.
- Push the commit to remote repo (GitHub).

** 2 ways of obtaining a GIT repo in local machine
1. Creating a new empty GIT repo
2. Clone an existing repo (from GITHUB)
